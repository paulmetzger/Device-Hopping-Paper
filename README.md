# Device-Hopping-Paper

This repository contains the parallel_for library and source-to-source translator that was used in the paper "Device-Hopping: Transparent Mid-Kernel Runtime Switching for Heterogeneous Systems", Metzger P., Seeker V., Fensch C., Cole M., to be published in ACM TACO.

The build.sh script creates a directory for build files, generates migratable CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenMP code from the high-level benchmark implementations with our parallel_for, builds the benchmarks, and sets up IPC.

Caution:
- The build script creates files in /dev/shm for IPC.
- One some installation the message queue size has to be changed with echo 1048576 > /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max

## Directory structure
| Directory | Description |
|:---|:---|
| benchmarks | Contains the high_level benchmark implementations with our parallel_for in separate .cpp files. The source-to-source translator will place its outputs also in this directory. Generated files are prefixed with _generated or are stored in "opencl_files", which will be created by the script that translates the benchmarks. |
| daemon | Source code of the daemon. |
| device_hopper | Contains the header library. The applications generated by the source-to-source translator use the code in this directory. |
| source_to_source_translator | Source code of the translator. |
| utils | Utilities, that, among other things, set up IPC and generate inputs for Rodinia NN and SHOC SPMV. |

## To do
- Create a script that automatically generates inputs for the benchmarks that load them from disk.
